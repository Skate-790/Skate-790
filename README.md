## Hi there <img height="25px" width="25px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1150bb26-1467-4ffe-b894-a4d2398892bb">

I’m Fabian, a web designer/web developer based in Germany.

I mostly design and build websites for customers, but sometimes also for myself or just for fun. 😅

If something comes to my mind, I try to build it.

I like working from scratch without using frameworks or modules from others, so I actually understand what those things do and how they work.

My main tech stack (as of now) is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My favorite tools for design are Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Figma.

I’ve been doing web design/web development since I was 12 years old, and I’ve built over a dozen websites so far, 
with the most recent being the website for my company, <a href="https://c-f-webdesign.de/">C-F Webdesign</a>.

**Fun Facts:**
- I have three cats
- I’m 20 years old
- I am a state-certified technical assistant for technical documentation.
